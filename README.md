# Bike-Sales-Analysis
This project explores a bike sales dataset to uncover key factors affecting consumer decision across regions. Through data analysis and visualization, the study identifies demographic, economic, and behavioural trends that influence bike purchases.
# Introduction
Welcome to our Sales Report Presentation. Today, we delve into a comprehensive overview of our sales performance, exploring the highs, challenges, and strategic insights that have shaped our journey. This presentation is more than just numbers, it's a narrative of our collective efforts, showcasing the impact of our sales strategies and the pathways to future success.
# Statement of Problem
Despite the growing emphasis on sustainable transportation and healthy lifestyles, the overall bike ownership rate across different regions remains below average of the entire sample size. This indicates a potential gap in understanding the key drivers that influence customers’ decisions to purchase bike.
# Objectives
The objective of this study is to identify and analyze the factors that significantly impact the decision-making process of potential bike buyers across various regions. By uncovering these insights, stakeholders such as manufacturers, retailers, and urban planners can design more targeted strategies to encourage bike adoption to contribute to the rate of bike positively, reduce traffic congestion, and improved environmental incomes.
# Tools and Methodology
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for preliminary data cleaning, exploration, analysis, and dashboard creation.
- **ChatGPT:** Used to refine definition of the statement of problem, and other technical writing aspect.
# Key Insights/Customer Demography
- **Code of Conduct**
  Our customer base spans various age groups, with a significant portion falling within the middle age (adults) range, indicating a strong appeal to the middle-aged demographic.
- **Geogrpahic Distribution**
  Geographically, our customers are distributed across 3 Major Regions (Europe, North America, and Pacific), highlighting our reach and effectiveness in diverse markets.
- **Educational Influence**
Our customer is diversified across educational level, with a substantial proportion among the Partial College.
- **Commute Distance.**
Analyzing our customers commute distance with respect to their occupation, Cinica Staffs cover the least distance of 0-1 Miles, and the Professionas cover above 10 Mies the most, this could contribute to their choices of getting a bike.
# Project Limitation. 
- **Binary Outcome Simplification**
The purchased bike field is binary. This may oversimplify the decision-making process (e.g; intent to purchase, past ownership, or interest without purchase are not captured.
- **Missing Seasonal Context.**
Without date, or time-series data, it’s hard to identify trends over time, seasonality, or impact of specific events.
- Limited Behavioural Data
The dataset, despite having demographic data, lacks in-depth transactional data, or even detailed behavioral insights (e.g, motivation, satisfaction, reasons for not purchasing, and so on.)
# Recommendation
- Focus on Regions With Low Purchase Rates
After discovering that certain regions show lower bike purchase rate, the company should collaborate with local governments to improve biking infrastructure, and safety. Launch regional campaigns to raise awareness of biking benefits and provide incentives
- Promote Biking As a Commute Option
Individuals with commute distances under 5 miles are more likely to purchase bikes. We can create campaigns that position biking as a cost-effective and healthy alternative to car commutes. Partner with employers to offer bike-to-work programs and community perks
- Leverage Family-Oriented Products and Campaigns
Having households with children showing potential as bike buyers, bunde bike packages, or offer promotions on kids bikes when parent purchase adult models. Emphasize family health, bonding,and weekend recreation in promotions.
