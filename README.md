# Introduction
Welcome to our Sales Report Presentation. Today, we delve into a comprehensive overview of our sales performance, exploring the highs, challenges, and strategic insights that have shaped our journey. This presentation is more than just numbers, it's a narrative of our collective efforts, showcasing the impact of our sales strategies and the pathways to future success.
# Statement of Problem
Despite the growing emphasis on sustainable transportation and heathy lifestyles, the overall bike ownership rate across different regions remains below average of the entire sample size. This indicates a potential gap in understanding the key drivers that influence customersâ€™ decisions to purchase bike.
# Objectives
The objective of this study is to identify and analyze the factors that significantly impact the decision-making process of potential bike buyers across various regions. By uncovering these insights, stakeholders such as manufacturers, retailers, and urban planners can design more targeted strategies to encourage bike adoption to contribute to the rate of bike positively, reduce traffic congestion, and improved environmental incomes.
